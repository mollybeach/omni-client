    "content": "C5AR1 is a gene that encodes the complement C5a receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune response. This receptor is primarily expressed on immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, where it mediates the effects of the complement component C5a, a potent inflammatory peptide. The C5AR1 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of the GPCR family, and is involved in various signaling pathways that lead to immune responses, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and cytokine release. The receptor's activation involves coupling with the G\u00ce\u00b1i subtype of heterotrimeric G proteins, resulting in downstream signaling events crucial for immune modulation (Feng2023Mechanism; Pandey2020Emerging). C5AR1's role extends beyond immune function, as it is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes to inflammation and disease progression (Lawal2021PanCancer; Carvalho2022Modulation).",

Upon binding to C5a, C5AR1 activates signaling pathways that lead to various immune responses, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and cytokine release. This receptor is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, where it contributes to the proinflammatory response (Feng2023Mechanism; Pandey2020Emerging).\n\nC5AR1 functions through coupling with the G\u00ce\u00b1i subtype of heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to the inhibition of cAMP levels and mobilization of intracellular calcium ions. This activation results in the recruitment of \u00ce\u00b2-arrestins, which facilitate receptor internalization and modulate downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Pandey2019Partial; Pandey2020Emerging).\n\nThe receptor's activation is characterized by significant structural rearrangements, particularly in the transmembrane domains, which facilitate the creation of a cytoplasmic cavity for G protein coupling. These structural changes are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and immune response modulation (Feng2023Mechanism).",

    "title": "Clinical Significance",
    "content": "C5AR1, or complement C5a receptor 1, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in immune and inflammatory responses. In cancer, high expression of C5AR1 is linked to chemotherapy resistance in breast, ovarian, colorectal, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancers. It is also associated with poor outcomes in immune checkpoint therapies, such as PD1+CTLA4 therapy in melanoma and PD1 therapy in GBM and kidney cancer (Lawal2021PanCancer). Genetic alterations, including mutations and copy number variations, in C5AR1 are associated with immune evasion and therapy resistance in multiple cancer types (Lawal2021PanCancer).\n\nIn Alzheimer's disease (AD), C5AR1 signaling is implicated in neuroinflammation and disease progression. Ablation of C5AR1 in mouse models has been shown to delay cognitive decline and reduce inflammatory responses, suggesting that C5AR1 contributes to the detrimental inflammatory environment in AD (Hernandez2017Prevention; Carvalho2022Modulation). The modulation of C5AR1 signaling affects microglial and astrocyte activation, which are key players in AD pathology (Carvalho2022Modulation). These findings indicate that targeting C5AR1 could be a therapeutic strategy in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.",
